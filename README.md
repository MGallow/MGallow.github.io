# Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website which you can find [here](http://users.stat.umn.edu/~gall0441/) or [here](https://mgallow.github.io/). Note that I have excluded several images and documents from the "images" repository.

You are welcome to clone this repository and tweak the code to your liking.

The website uses the [orderedlist](https://github.com/orderedlist) theme.
